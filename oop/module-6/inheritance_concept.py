"""
OOP: Object Oriented Programming:

* Class * Object

* Attribute * methods

** Class -> can be -> Private -> Protected -> Public
** Private: if you make something private in class suppose in parent class you make private than you only access this private property in parent class.
** Protected: child class only can access protected property.
** Public: all can access public properties.

*** 4 Pillar of OOP ***
 
** Inheritance ** Encapsulation ** polymorphism ** Abstraction  

1. simple inheritance: parent class --> child class (gadget --> phone, laptop etc.)

2. multi-level inheritance : Grandpa --> Parent --> child (Vehicle --> Bus --> Ac-Bus)

3. Multiple inheritance: Student (Family, School, Sports)

4. Hybrid: Grandpa --> Father, uncle, Aunty --> child (father, uncle)
